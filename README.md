# LinkFileBot

LinkFileBot is a collection of scripts for a Reddit bot, made using Praw, that provides information on a link (e.g. title, website) that is found in a comment.

## Usage

```bash
python3 LinkFileBot.py
```

Will start the script. The target subreddit can be changed by editing the string in reddit.subreddit(string) on line 22 of LinkFileBot.py (will be changed in the future)
